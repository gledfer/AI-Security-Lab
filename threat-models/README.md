ðŸ“‹** Overview**

This repository provides a comprehensive framework for threat modeling Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning systems. As AI systems introduce unique attack surfaces beyond traditional software, this framework helps identify, analyze, and mitigate security risks specific to AI components like training data, ML models, and inference pipelines.

ðŸŽ¯ Types of Threat Models Covered

**1. Data-Centric Threat Models**

Focus: Protecting training data and inference data

Key Risks: Data poisoning, membership inference attacks, training data extraction

Approach: Data provenance tracking, integrity checks, differential privacy

**2. Model-Centric Threat Models**

Focus: Protecting the ML model itself

Key Risks: Model extraction, model inversion, adversarial examples

Approach: Model hardening, adversarial training, output perturbation

**3. Pipeline-Centric Threat Models**
Focus: Securing the end-to-end ML workflow

Key Risks: Supply chain attacks, CI/CD pipeline compromises

Approach: Secure MLOps practices, container security, access controls

**4. Application-Centric Threat Models**
Focus: AI system integration and APIs

Key Risks: Prompt injection, model evasion, API abuse

Approach: Input validation, rate limiting, monitoring
