# AI-Security-Lab

AI Security Practitioner 

Hello! My name is **Gledson Fernandes** and this repository documents my journey and experiments at the intersection of **Cybersecurity** and **Artificial Intelligence**.

I am an **Information Security Specialist** with over 9 years of experience in highly complex corporate environments (such as **Cielo** and **Atento**), and I'm expanding my career to specialize in **AI Red Team** and **ML Security**. My goal is to protect systems against emerging threats like prompt injection, model evasion and data poisoning.
